# docker-MuSE
Dockerfile for MuSE.

MuSE is a tool for fast and accurate calling of somatic point mutation from normal-tumor paired samples. MuSE uses Markov substitution model to detect somatic mutation for whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing samples. Details can be found [here](https://github.com/wwylab/MuSE).
